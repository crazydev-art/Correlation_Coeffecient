Air Pollution Correlation Analysis
This  repository contains a Python script for analyzing the correlation between carbon monoxide (CO) levels and ozone (O3) levels in air pollution data. The script calculates the correlation coefficient using the Pearson correlation formula.

Key Components:
Data Source:

The script reads data from a file named "airpolution.txt." The data includes information about cities, months, years, CO levels, O3 levels, and temperature.
Correlation Calculation:

The script calculates the correlation coefficient between CO and O3 levels using the Pearson correlation formula.
Variables like Nominator_float and Denominator_float are used in the correlation calculation.
Data Processing:

The script processes each line of the input file, extracts relevant data, and accumulates sums needed for correlation calculation.
It skips the header line with the condition data[0]!="Ville".

Dependencies:

The script relies on the math module for mathematical operations.

Example Output:
The script prints the correlation coefficient, providing insights into the relationship between CO and O3 levels in the given air pollution dataset.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or extend the functionality of this script to suit your specific needs. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
